Operational database management systems (also referred to as OLTP On Line Transaction Processing databases), are used to update data in real-time. These types of databases allow users to do more than simply view archived data. Operational databases allow you to modify that data (add, change or delete data), doing it in real-time.[1] OLTP databases provide transactions as main abstraction to guarantee data consistency that guarantee the so-called ACID properties. Basically, the consistency of the data is guaranteed in the case of failures and/or concurrent access to the data. 

Following this ideology, the purpose is provide a system of transaction using JAVA language to interfaces and SQL(server and client) to coomunication between application.

### To use this application you need:

```bash
- openjdk - default
- openjde - default
- netbeans 11
- sql-server
- sql-client
- sql management studio
```

## Installation 

Java Developer Kit (JDK) : `$ sudo apt-get install default-jdk`
Java Runtime Environment (JRE) : `$ sudo apt-get install default-jre`
Netbeans: `$ sudo apt-get netbeans`
Sql-server and client: `$sudo apt-get sql-server && sudo apt-get sql-client`
